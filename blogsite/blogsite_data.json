      "author": 1,
      "body": "An Azure storage account works in a similar way as your Wardrobe in terms of storing your data in the cloud.\r\n\r\nAn Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that’s accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.\r\n\r\nAzure Storage Account has four supported storage services: (1) Blobs (containers), (2) Files, (3) Queues, and (4) tables.\r\n\r\nIn this article, I will take you by the hand and walk through a step-by-step journey on how you can successfully create and manage blob storage in your Azure Management Portal.\r\n\r\nWhat is Azure Blob Storage?\r\n\r\nBlob stands for Binary Large Object\r\n\r\nAzure Blob Storage is Microsoft’s object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn’t adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.\r\n\r\nYou can picture Azure Blob Storage as a container for storing all your data objects, like websites, pictures, videos, computer games, documents, etc.\r\n\r\nBlob Storage is designed for:\r\n\r\nServing images or documents directly to a browser.\r\nStoring files for distributed access.\r\nStreaming video and audio.\r\nWriting to log files.\r\nStoring data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.\r\nStoring data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.\r\nIn this article, we will follow a step to step approach to creating a Blob storage account and explain its three tiers in the sequential order below:\r\n\r\n1) Create Azure Free Account\r\n\r\n2) Create Storage Account\r\n\r\n3) Create Blob Container\r\n\r\n4) Explain the three Access Tiers\r\n\r\nLet’s get started!\r\n\r\n1) Create a free Azure Account to get started\r\n\r\n2) Create a Storage Account:\r\n\r\na) Sign in to the Azure Portal\r\n\r\nb) Click on the search bar and type “Storage Account”\r\n\r\nc) Click on “Create” to go to the “Basics” setup section\r\n\r\n\r\nd) Under the project details in the Basics section, choose your subscription\r\n\r\ne) Click on “Create new” to create a new resource group (a container that holds related resources for the Azure solution) for your storage account.\r\n\r\n\r\nf) Under the instance details, give your storage account a globally unique name.\r\n\r\nWhen naming your storage account, keep these rules in mind:\r\n\r\nStorage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.\r\nYour storage account name must be unique within Azure. No two storage accounts can have the same name.\r\ng) For cost optimization, select the standard performance\r\n\r\nh) For redundancy, select the Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) because this option gives you a failover capability into another region and it is recommended by Microsoft for backup purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni) Click on the Advanced Tab\r\n\r\nj) On the Access tier, click on “Hot”\r\n\r\n\r\nk) Click on the Networking Tab\r\n\r\nl) Under the Network Connectivity section, click on “Enable public access from all networks” This option allows access to your storage account over the Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nm) In the network routing section, click on the Microsoft network routing radio button\r\n\r\n\r\nn) On the Data Protection Tab, leave the recovery options in the default mode.\r\n\r\n\r\no) You can skip the Tag and the Encryption Tab and click “Review” to make sure all the settings are correct. The review option validates your settings and gives you a summary of your resource.\r\n\r\np) Once the validation is passed, click on “Create”\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Create Blob Container\r\n\r\na) Click on the storage you created",

      "author": 1,
      "body": "In all, there are four fundamental ways to become a U.S. citizen: citizenship by birth in the U.S., citizenship through derivation, citizenship through acquisition, and citizenship through naturalization. Most immigrants in the United States become citizens through the naturalization process. In fact, nearly one million permanent residents apply for naturalization each year.\r\n\r\nCitizenship through Birth\r\nUnder United States law, any person born within the United States (including the territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands) is automatically granted U.S. citizenship. There is an exemption for children of parents who are foreign diplomats or members of a sovereign Native American tribe. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that:\r\n\r\n\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\r\n\r\nAs most Americans are born on U.S. soil, this is clearly the post common of the ways to become a U.S. citizen. The next three paths address ways foreign nationals can obtain citizenship.\r\n\r\n2\r\nCitizenship through Acquisition\r\nIn some circumstances, a child automatically “acquires” citizenship even though that child was born outside the United States. At least one parent needs to be a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth and several other conditions must be met. When this child marries and has children, those children may also acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. The ways a child can become a U.S. citizen through acquisition generally include:\r\n\r\nBoth parents were U.S. citizens\r\nRequires that both parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child's birth and the parents were married at the time of birth abroad, and at least one parent lived in the U.S., or its territories, or both, prior to the child's birth.\r\nOne parent was a U.S. citizen\r\nRequires that one parent was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child's birth abroad; and the child was born on or after November 14, 1986; and the parents were married at the time of birth; and the U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the U.S. or its territories for a period of at least five years at some time in their life prior to the birth, of which at least two years were after their 14th birthday.\r\nOne parent was a U.S. citizen\r\nRequires that one parent was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child's birth abroad; and the birth date is before November 14, 1986, but after October 10, 1952; and the child's parents were married at the time of the birth; and the U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the U.S. or its territories for a period of at least ten years at some time in their life prior to the child's birth, at least five of which were after their 14th birthday.",
